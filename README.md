# 📬 Post Hub - microservices demo project

**Post Hub** is a demo project created for my Udemy course to demonstrate how microservices work in practice. It lets users register, log in, create posts and comments, and shows how services communicate via Kafka and are secured with JWT.

## 🔍 What the project does

- User registration and login (including Login with Google)
- Post and comment creation
- Action logging via Kafka
- Secure endpoints using JWT
- Web access via Gateway and Nginx
- Full microservices architecture + CI/CD deployment

## 🧩 Microservices overview

The project is divided into four key services:

- **IAM-service** - handles user accounts, authentication/registration, and post/comment creation. Uses JWT for security and Flyway for database migrations.
- **UTILS-service** - logs user activities like post/comment creation. Receives events from IAM-service via Kafka.
- **GATEWAY-service** - main entry point for all external requests. Routes traffic to the correct service and checks authentication.
- **DISCOVERY-service** - uses Consul for automatic service registration and communication.

## ⚙️ Tech stack

- **Java + Spring Boot** — backend microservices
- **Spring Security + JWT** — authentication and authorization
- **Kafka** — messaging between services
- **Docker** — containerized deployment
- **PostgreSQL (on AWS)** — main production database
- **Flyway** — database migration tool
- **Consul** — service discovery
- **Nginx** — reverse proxy and SSL termination

## 🚀 Deployment Process

Each microservice is packaged as a Docker image and pushed to Docker Hub. CI/CD is managed through GitLab, and the deployment pipeline includes:

1. Fetching logs from the server
2. Stopping and removing running containers
3. Building the project JAR files
4. Creating and pushing Docker images
5. Deploying updated containers on the server

## 🗄️ Database & Hosting

- **Database** - PostgreSQL hosted on AWS via ScaleGrid
- **Hosting** - deployed on a VPS with Docker and Nginx configured for routing, HTTPS, and performance
